 *
 *Definition - What does Thread mean?
 *A thread, in the context of Java, is the path followed when executing a program.
 * All Java programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, which is created by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at the programâ€™s start,
 * when the main() method is invoked with the main thread.
 *
 * The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.

/**
 * Defining the Thread by extending Thread Class
 *
 * Thread scheduler is the part of JVM.
 * Responsible for scheduling thread, i,e if multiple threads are waiting to get the chance of execution then
 * in which order Thread will be executed by Thread Scheduler
 *
 * We can't expect exact algorithm followed by Thread scheduler. It is varied from JVM to JVM. Hence we can't expect Thread
 * execution order and Exact output.
